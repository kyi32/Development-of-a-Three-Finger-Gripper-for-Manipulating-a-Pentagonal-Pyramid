# Development of a Three-Finger Gripper for Manipulating a Pentagonal Pyramid

## Overview
This repository contains the design files and documentation for a three-finger gripper developed to manipulate a hollow wooden pentagonal pyramid. The project includes 3D models of the gripper components and a detailed report outlining the design process, component selection, and assembly instructions.

## Files
### 3D Models
- `Assembly6.iam`: The main assembly file for the three-finger gripper.
- `BELT.ipt`: Belt component for the gripper mechanism.
- `Part140.ipt`: Part of the gripper assembly.
- `distanceSensor.ipt`: Distance sensor component.
- `finger1.ipt`: First finger of the gripper.
- `finger2.ipt`: Second finger of the gripper.
- `palm.ipt`: Palm component of the gripper.
- `palmPlatform.ipt`: Platform supporting the palm.
- `platform.ipt`: Base platform of the gripper.
- `rubber.ipt`: Rubber pad for the fingertips.
- `touchingSensor.ipt`: Touch sensor component.

### Documentation
- `Development of a Three-Finger Gripper for Manipulating a Pentagonal Pyramid.pdf`: Detailed report including design rationale, component selection (Universal Robot UR3, Tekscan FlexiForce, Lidar-Lite v3, NEMA 14/17 motors, A4988/DRV8825 drivers), key calculations, and assembly instructions.

## Project Details
- **Objective**: Design a gripper to handle a pentagonal pyramid with a base of 3-5 cm, height of 6-8 cm, and wall thickness of 4 mm.
- **Gripper Type**: Three-finger gripper with soft padding for even pressure distribution.
- **Robotic Arm**: Universal Robot UR3 (6 DOF, 3 kg payload, 500 mm reach, Â±0.1 mm repeatability).
- **Mechanism**: Belt-driven system for smooth and precise movement.

## Assembly Instructions
Refer to the `Development of a Three-Finger Gripper for Manipulating a Pentagonal Pyramid.pdf` for step-by-step instructions on assembling the gripper components, including:
1. Platform connection
2. Attaching the palm platform
3. Mounting the palm
4. Connecting the fingers
5. Installing belts
6. Adding touch sensors
7. Securing rubber pads
8. Mounting the distance sensor
9. General wiring considerations
